&nbsp;❄️ Snowflow-Warehouse



A modern, scalable data warehouse solution that combines the power of \*\*Snowflake\*\*, \*\*Apache Airflow\*\*, and \*\*AWS\*\* to deliver efficient ETL pipelines and robust data orchestration.



&nbsp;🚀 Overview



\*\*Snowflow-Warehouse\*\* is designed to simplify the end-to-end data pipeline lifecycle — from ingestion and transformation to loading and warehousing — all built on top of a modular and cloud-native architecture.



This project is ideal for teams looking to implement reliable data engineering workflows with modern tooling.





&nbsp;🏗️ Architecture



The solution is built using the following components:



\- \*\*Apache Airflow\*\* – Manages and orchestrates ETL workflows using DAGs

\- \*\*Snowflake\*\* – Acts as the core data warehouse, enabling scalable, high-performance queries

\- \*\*AWS\*\*:

&nbsp; - \*\*S3\*\* – Stores raw and processed data

&nbsp; - \*\*Lambda\*\* – Handles serverless processing and event triggers

&nbsp; - \*\*Glue\*\* – (Optional) Used for cataloging and additional transformation

\- \*\*ETL Pipelines\*\* – Written in Python, containerized with Docker, capable of handling structured and semi-structured data





&nbsp;📦 Features



\- Modular and scalable ETL design

\- Automated scheduling via Airflow DAGs

\- Integration with Snowflake for seamless data warehousing

\- Support for AWS-native tools to enhance pipeline performance

\- Dockerized environment for local development and deployment
